s3cms
=====
For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, S3CMS will be maintained according to the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>

Constructed with the following guidelines:

    A new major release indicates a large change where backwards compatibility is broken.
    A new minor release indicates a normal change that maintains backwards compatibility.
    A new patch release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
    A new build release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.
